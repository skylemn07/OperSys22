In this case, we can notice that the program runs longer compared to task 3 with the corresponding number of threads, since there are time intervals when the thread is idle due to mutex. Moreover, multicore does not help here. Also, when the number of threads increases, the program execution time increases due to the fact that only 1 thread is running at one time, and all the others are waiting. That is, the more threads - the more downtime and less CPU utilization.
